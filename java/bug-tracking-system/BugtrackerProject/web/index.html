            <h1>Group B Bug Tracking System</h1>
            <p class="disclaimer"><span class="note">Please note:</span> all pages in this system use a servlet that then dictates
            what jsp file is displayed.  For this reason, this is the only static page on
            the site and therefore is the only page capable of being displayed as a &#8220;Github Page&#8221;.</p>
            <p class="disclaimer"><span class="note">Please note:</span> the word ticket is used throughout this project instead of bug.  The word ticket is broader in its scope, and this
            system could be used for administering a project so therefore the word ticket was chosen since it is more all encompassing.</p>
            
            <h3>Structural Integrity of the Project</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The database is normalized. Also, keys, constraints, and indexes have been created every time one is needed. 
                    This prevents orphaned records and all other database anomalies.</li>
                <li>Allows users to login, view tickets, filter tickets, create tickets, and edit tickets.</li>
                <li>The pages are dynamically designed. JSP is used to render lists and drop down menus from the database.
                    Also, the edit ticket page has the same url as the create ticket page.  A get variable determines which one is displayed.</li>
                <li>The architectural design allows for this code to be reused and extended.</li>
                <li>All forms are heavily validated. Error messages will be displayed for many different possible outcomes.</li>
                <li>If a user uses a development tool to inject values where it would be impossible for a regular user to do so,
                    the system understands its an invalid request.
                </li>
            </ul>
